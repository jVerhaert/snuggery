# This line does two things:
# - enable git's CRLF -> LF modification
# - tell git to guess whether files are text or binary
*                 text=auto

# Set the language for these files to json5 to ensure GitHub doesn't show the comments as errors
/.vscode/*.json   linguist-language=JSON5

# Hide .yarn from GitHub's language detection
/.yarn/**         linguist-vendored

# Mark .pnp.cjs as generated for GitHub's language detection
/.pnp.cjs         linguist-generated
/.pnp.loader.mjs  linguist-generated
